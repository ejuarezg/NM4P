# README for Python Files

- The scripts `Balle.py` and `Pendul.py` (located in `Python/Raw Python/`
folder) have been verified to produce the same results as in the book. All other
scripts have been updated to Python 3 without verification.
- Jupyter notebooks have not been updated yet.
- The script `input_parser` located in `Python/extra/` is not part of the
original code by Alejandro Garcia.
